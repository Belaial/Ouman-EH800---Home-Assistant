Please visit the link above for help and further discussions, I just decided to try and keep all information collected in a good way since the forum-post has gotten quite messy over time, I will do my best to keep this page up to date with new changes if there are any.
A special thanks goes out to all the people over at the Home Assistant forum for figuring all this out!
